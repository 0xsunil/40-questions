## 40 questions to ask yourself each year

One of my rituals at the end the year is asking myself these forty questions. This list is modified from a set of questions posted by [coppermoss](https://ask.metafilter.com/254216/What-are-your-tools-and-rituals-for-reflecting-on-the-past-year) on Metafilter.

It usually takes me about a week to work my way through all of them. I find it to be one of the most valuable exercises to reflect on what happened, good and bad, and how I hope the year ahead will shape up.

What is more interesting than each individual answer are the trends that emerge after years of answering the same questions. Iâ€™ve shared this list with my family and closest friends, and always enjoy discussing answers as we reflect on the year.

Feel free to add or remove questions, and [share your edits with me](https://twitter.com/kepano). This is first and foremost a personal exercise, so make it a tradition you can enjoy for years to come.
